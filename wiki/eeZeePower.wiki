A simple, small, 3.3V/5V USB breadboard power supply.

= Introduction =

A simple, small, low-cost, USB breadboard power adapter. 

Sick of hunting around for something to power your projects? I was. No longer.

Plug in your USB mini-B, select 3.3V or 5V (USB voltage), plug it into a dual-rail breadboard, and you have power. 

  * Selectable 3.3V / VUSB (5V) output
  * USB Mini-B input
  * Stable: two sets of output pins for stable installation
  * Small; only takes up a tiny corner of the breadboard
  * 100uF and 0.1uF filtering capacitors on the output
  * 10uF and 0.1uF filtering caps on the regulator input
  * All SMT components populated

All you have to do is add pin headers and jumper.

Designed and assembled in the United States of America.

= Installation =

Install a 3-pin header for the VUSB/3.3V output selector, and two 2-pin headers for Vcc/GND output.

= Configuration =

3.3V: place the jumper nearest the 3.3V label
5V: place the jumper nearest the VUSB label
