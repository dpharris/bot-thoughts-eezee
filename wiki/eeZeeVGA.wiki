#summary Add VGA output to your Propeller project with this kit

= Introduction =

Your Propeller can generate VGA output with some software from the OBEX and this board, once you add pin headers.

Designed especially for breadboard experiments with the eeZee Propeller breakout board but it will work with many other configurations, too.

= Assembly Instructions =

I prefer to use a flux pen and to clean my soldering iron tip with brass wool, and use 0.022" or 0.032" solder. That's what works best for me, anyway.

  # Insert a wire for ground if necessary/desired and solder.
  # Insert the pin header, long side, in a breadboard (optional).
  # Place the board onto the short side pin headers.
  # Holding the board perpendicular to the pin header, solder one pin.
  # Adjust alignment until it's perpendicular.
  # Solder the remaining pins.
  # Clean flux with alcohol or mineral spirits and a tooth brush.

= Software =

You can find demonstration VGA code shipped with the Parallax Propeller Tool. You can also search for VGA demos and objects on the Parallax [http://obex.parallax.com/search/vga OBEX].
