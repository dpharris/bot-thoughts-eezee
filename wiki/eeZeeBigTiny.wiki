= Introduction =

After breadboarding a bunch of ATtinys I built these boards so I didn't have to look up the AVR ISP pinout every time.

= Features =



All 8 pins exposed
Tiny 1 sq-in. board
0.1uF and 10uF (or larger) filtering capacitors
Reset switch and pull-up resistor included
Works with ATtiny13,13A, ATtiny25,45,85, ATtiny11, ATtiny12

  * AVR ISP header included to save time
  * All 20 pins exposed
  * Included 16MHz crystal and caps**
  * 0.1uF and 10uF (or larger) filtering capacitors
  * Reset switch and pull-up resistor included
  * Works with ATtiny2313, ATtiny4313
  * Compact board

** You can order it without these if you want.

= Assembly =

  * Solder on each 10-pin header
  * Solder on the 20-pin DIP socket
    * Align the notch with the board silkscreen
    * Notch is farthest from ISP and reset
  * Solder on the 2x3-pin AVR ISP pin header on top
  * Solder on the reset switch
  * Insert your ATtiny2313/4313 into the socket

= Example Code =

This example code sequentially turns on one of each of the Tiny's pins.

= Operating Conditions =

Please use your ATtiny breakout boards with regulated supplies of 5V or less, with minimal ripple, at temperatures around 25C (77F). Do not use the boards in higher temperature conditions or with higher sustained voltages.
