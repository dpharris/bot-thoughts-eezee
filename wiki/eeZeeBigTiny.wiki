= Introduction =

I want to do more ATtiny2313 projects and I prototype on breadboards. This target / breakout board will make it easier to get started. The board is a surface-mount evolution of an open source through hole design.

= Features =

Easily prototype and program your 20-pin ATtiny with this breakout / target board. Use AVRISP or FTDI for programming.

The eeZee Big Tiny is a surface mount version of an open source through-hole design. I wanted one and others did, too so here it is!

  * Works with ATtiny2313, ATtiny4313
  * Included 16MHz crystal and caps**
  * FTDI header for bootloader programming
  * Compact AVRISP connector for easy programming
  * Perfect for breadboarding
  * 0.1uF and 100uF filtering capacitors pre-soldered
  * All 20 pins exposed for breadboarding
  * Reset switch and pull-up resistor included
  * All you need to do is solder in the pin headers and add your own 20- pin ATtiny.

= Pinout =

Place the index tab on your 6-pin AVRISP (IDC) connector towards the MCU. The upper left pin in the picture, below left, is pin 1, MISO. Refer to the 6-pin AVRISP pinout diagram. below right.
