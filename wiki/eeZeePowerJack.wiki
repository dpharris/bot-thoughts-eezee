#summary A simple, small, 5V USB breadboard power adapter.

= Introduction =

A simple, small, low-cost, breadboard power adapter.

Sick of hunting around for something to power your projects? I was. No longer.

  * 6V DC input
  * Common 2.1mm power jack, center positive, like Arduino
  * 5V, 1.5A output meets nearly all breadboard needs
  * Small; only takes up a tiny corner of the breadboard
  * Two sets of output pins for stable installation
  * 100uF and 0.1uF filtering capacitors on the output
  * 10uF and 0.1uF filtering caps on the regulator input
  * All SMT components populated

All you have to do is add pin headers.

Designed and assembled in the United States of America.

= Installation =

  # Break your breakway header into two 2-pin headers
  # Solder in the two 2-pin headers for Vcc/GND output, long end down
  # Use a 6V wall-wart power supply with 2.1mm jack with center-positive configuration
