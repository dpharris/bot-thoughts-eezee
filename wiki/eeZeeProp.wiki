= Introduction =

Ready for pre-order on [https://tindie.com/shops/bot_thoughts/eezee-propeller/ Tindie]

The Parallax Propeller is truly a unique and amazing chip, with 8 cogs running simultaneously and many innovative features and incredible flexibility.

The eeZee Prop brings that power to the breadboard a budget-friendly breakout board ideal for prototyping. 

Program it with your existing FTDI or Prop Plug programmer. 

The board has a reset button and a power LED, and nothing else to get in the way of your creativity.

= Features =

  * Works with your existing FTDI and Prop Plug programmers
  * A Propeller in breadboard-friendly 36-DIP form factor, 0.8" wide
  * Low cost without unneeded add-ons, perfect for prototyping
  * Onboard 3.3V LDO regulator, flexible power options
  * Includes 5MHz crystal, 256Kbit EEPROM, Reset switch, Power LED
  * Exposes reset pin
  * Fabricated and assembled in the USA

= Programming =

You can either use an FTDI or Prop Plug to program your eeZee Prop.

  * Prop Plug: provide power through the VIN pin
  * FTDI 3.3V -> power externally through VIN
  * FTDI 5V -> powers the prop plug

== Other Serial Programmers ==

Other serial adapters can be made to work, you just need a programmer with DTR, RX, TX, and GND.

  * Vcc -> (opt) tie to power, or see Power below
  * RXI -> tie to receive (prop out, pc in)
  * TXO -> tie to transmit (prop in, pc out)
  * DTR -> this resets the prop
  * GND -> ground

= Power = 

Rev 0.2 Input Voltage: 5.02-8.0V @ 700mA ; 4.75-8.0V @ 100mA. Note: lower input voltages are typically possible but not guaranteed in all cases.

The eeZee Prop can be powered in several ways
  * 3.3V Pin: Connect external 3.3V source, but no power on VIN, FTDI-Vcc
  * VIN: Connect power, can also have voltage in on FTDI Vcc pin, 3.3V is output
  * FTDI Vcc pin: Connect power (specs TBD), can also have voltage on VIN, 3.3V is output

Other existing programming boards include the [http://www.parallax.com/Store/Microcontrollers/PropellerDevelopmentBoards/tabid/514/CategoryID/73/List/0/Level/a/ProductID/802/Default.aspx?SortField=ProductName%2cProductName Propeller Board of Education], [http://www.parallax.com/Store/Microcontrollers/PropellerDevelopmentBoards/tabid/514/CategoryID/73/List/0/catpageindex/2/Level/a/ProductID/411/Default.aspx?SortField=ProductName%2cProductName PropStick USB], [http://www.schmartboard.com/index.asp?page=products_populated&id=205 SchmartBoard SchmartModule], [http://www.parallax.com/Store/Microcontrollers/PropellerDevelopmentBoards/tabid/514/CategoryID/73/List/0/Level/a/ProductID/748/Default.aspx?SortField=ProductName%2cProductName Propeller QuickStart] board, and others.

The eeZee Prop is breadboard friendly like the !PropStick USB, but budget friendly like the !QuickStart.  It doesn't add another virtual com port to your system because you use your existing programmer as with the SchmartBoard and others.
