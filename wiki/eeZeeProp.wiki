A budget- and breadboard-friendly Parallax Propeller breakout board

= Introduction =

*Coming mid-Dec, 2012!*

The Parallax Propeller is truly an amazing chip, unlike anything else out there, with 8 cogs running simultaneously and many innovative features and incredible flexibility.

Existing programming boards include the [http://www.parallax.com/Store/Microcontrollers/PropellerDevelopmentBoards/tabid/514/CategoryID/73/List/0/Level/a/ProductID/802/Default.aspx?SortField=ProductName%2cProductName Propeller Board of Education], [http://www.parallax.com/Store/Microcontrollers/PropellerDevelopmentBoards/tabid/514/CategoryID/73/List/0/catpageindex/2/Level/a/ProductID/411/Default.aspx?SortField=ProductName%2cProductName PropStick USB], [http://www.schmartboard.com/index.asp?page=products_populated&id=205 SchmartBoard SchmartModule], [http://www.parallax.com/Store/Microcontrollers/PropellerDevelopmentBoards/tabid/514/CategoryID/73/List/0/Level/a/ProductID/748/Default.aspx?SortField=ProductName%2cProductName Propeller QuickStart] board, and others.

The eeZee Prop is a budget-friendly board like the QuickStart and SchmartBoard, but breadboard-friendly like the PropStick USB. It relies on an external FTDI or Prop Plug programmer and has a reset button and a power LED, and nothing else to get in the way of your creativity.

  * Works with your existing FTDI and Prop Plug programmers
  * Propeller in breadboard friendly DIP package
  * Onboard 3.3V regulator

= Programming =

You can either use an FTDI or Prop Plug to program your eeZee Prop.

  * PropPlug: provide power through the VIN pin
  * FTDI 3.3V -> power externally through VIN
  * FTDI 5V -> powers the prop plug

== Other Serial Programmers ==

Other serial adapters can be made to work, you just need a programmer with DTR, RX, TX, and GND.

Vcc -> tie to 5V if available or power the regulator through VIN
RXI -> tie to receive (prop out, pc in)
TXO -> tie to transmit (prop in, pc out)
DTR -> this resets the prop
GND -> ground

= Power = 

The eeZee Prop can be powered in several ways
  * 3.3V Pin: Connect external 3.3V source, but no power on VIN, FTDI-Vcc
  * VIN: Connect 5V, can also have voltage in on FTDI-Vcc, 3.3V is output
  * FTDI Vcc: Connect 5V, can also have voltage on VIN, 3.3V is output
