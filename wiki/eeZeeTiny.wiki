= Introduction =

I've built enough ATtiny13 breadboard circuits that I got really sick of hooking up everything. Based on a through hole design, the eeZee Tiny uses surface mount components for a truly tiny board for breadboarding and programming your 8-pin ATtiny.

= Features =

  * Works with ATtiny13,13A, ATtiny25,45,85, ATtiny11, ATtiny12
  * Tiny 1-square-inch board
  * Perfect for breadboarding
  * 0.1uF and 10uF (or larger) filtering capacitors pre-soldered
  * Compact AVRISP connector for easy programming
  * All 8 pins exposed for breadboarding
  * Reset switch and pull-up resistor included

= Assembly =

All you have to do is...

  * Solder on 10-pin headers on the bottom
  * Solder in the 20-pin DIP socket on the top if not yet installed
    * Align the notch with the board silkscreen
    * Notch should be farthest away from the switch and AVRISP header
    * (I goofed, I installed it backwards in the product picture)
  * Solder on the 6-pin AVRISP pin header on top
  * Solder on the reset switch if not installed already

= Operating Conditions =

Please use your ATtiny breakout boards with regulated supplies of 5V or less, with minimal ripple, at temperatures around 25C (77F). Do not use the boards in higher temperature conditions.
