Easy, quick programming and prototyping with 8-pin ATtiny devices

= Introduction =

After breadboarding a bunch of ATtinys I built these boards so I didn't have to look up the AVR ISP pinout every time.

= Features =

  * AVR ISP header included to save time
  * All 8 pins exposed
  * Tiny 1 sq-in. board
  * 0.1uF and 10uF (or larger) filtering capacitors
  * Reset switch and pull-up resistor included
  * Works with ATtiny13,13A, ATtiny25,45,85, ATtiny11, ATtiny12

= Assembly =

All you have to do is...

  * Break the 8-pin header in half
  * Solder on these two 4-pin headers
  * Solder on the 8-pin DIP socket on the top
    * Align the notch with the board silkscreen
  * Solder on the 2x3-pin AVR ISP pin header on top
  * Solder on the reset switch
  * Insert your 8-pin ATtiny into the socket

= Programming =

The Pololu AVR Programmer is my preferred programmer for most ATtiny projects. Buy the Pololu AVR Programmer at [http://www.pololu.com/product/1300 pololu.com]. Follow the instructions in the [http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J36 User's Guide pdf]

You can also use an AVRISP MkII, your Arduino ([http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP here's how]), or other AVR ISP compatible hardware.

== ISP Header ==

When it's time to plug in the eeZee Tiny board, locate the white rectangle next to the ISP header which marks the notch that would appear on a shrouded male header, as below.

= Example Code = 

This program cycles through a series of patterns on PB0-PB4. Hook up some LEDs and enjoy the light show.

= Operating Conditions =

Please use your ATtiny breakout boards with regulated supplies of 5V or less, with minimal ripple, at temperatures around 25C (77F). Do not use the boards in higher temperature conditions or with higher sustained voltages.
