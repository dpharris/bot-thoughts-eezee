Easy programming and prototyping with 8-pin ATtiny devices

= Introduction =

I've built enough ATtiny13 breadboard circuits that I got really sick of hooking up everything. Based on a through hole design, the eeZee Tiny uses surface mount components for a truly tiny board for breadboarding and programming your 8-pin ATtiny.

= Features =

  * 0.1uF and 10uF filtering capacitors pre-soldered
  * Compact AVRISP connector for easy programming
  * All 8 pins exposed for breadboarding
  * Reset switch and pull-up resistor included
